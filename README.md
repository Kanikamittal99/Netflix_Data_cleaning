- In this, we have worked on messy data to showcase data cleaning skills, one of the most important tasks before performing any data analysis.
- Leveraged Pythonâ€™s data manipulation libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to extract, clean, and preprocess raw Netflix data for accurate analysis.
- This dataset contains following columns - show_id, type, title,	director, cast,	country,	date_added,	release_year,	rating,	duration,	listed_in,	description

## Tasks Performed 
- Handling missing values(NaN) for each column
- Checking corrupted values(if any) and handling them
- Extracting year and month from date for further trend analysis
- Creating 2 datasets from the existing one -  TV Show & Movie
- Comparing Countries with iso package to find inconsistencies
